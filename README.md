# Random Python Utilities

This repository contains a set of short Python scripts which I use to automate some of my tasks. You are free to use them if you want, but I give no guarantees of them working on your system, as they are first and foremost tailored for my use. You are however free to look at the code and fix any issues yourself or to let me know about them in the GitHub Issues section. That said I don't promise on fixing them.
